#Oryx : A POSIX - Compliant Operating System ? ? ?

Oryx is the twin sister of [Orax](http://github.com/Chubek/Orax), my compiler. I still have not decided if I am going to go through with it. I may, I may not. Maybe it will be stillborn like a gazillion other operating system 'pet' projects out there. Maybe it will end up mainlined at Windows source tree. Maybe I'll end up dead in a ditch. Who knows?

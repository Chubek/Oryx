# Oryx : A Litewight Non - Compliant OS

Oryx is a liteweight, Non-Compliant OS. I started work on it very recently. And I have to figure out a lot of stuff. I just keep reading the seminal Dino Book and make progress.

I plan on reading all the research papers I can find on ACM archives and Microsoft's website. I want Oryx to be Non-Compliant, but the 'good' kind of Non-Compliant, not the type of Non-Compliance that subpar operating systems which don't stick to any standards have.

I shall soon get to work and start writing the specs for it. Just becuase Oryx is Non-Compliant, don't assume I am some loose-canon renegade. I am after all making a [C compiler](https://github.com/Chubek/Orax) too!


# IMPORTANT UPDATE

I decided to implement the OS in D!
